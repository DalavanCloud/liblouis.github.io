title: Liblouis Release 3.0.0.alpha1
category: Liblouis
---

This is the biggest release of liblouis in years. In order to support UEB the internals of liblouis have seen a major rewrite. New Opcodes have been added to support the requirements for proper UEB for example for emphasis handling or to handle proper translation of numbers. Changes to the opcodes are described in the [documentation](http://liblouis.org/documentation/).

Some of these changes are not backwards compatible. All tables that come with liblouis have been migrated. If you have private tables look at the section on upgrading from previous versions in the [wiki](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/wiki/Emphasis-Opcodes#upgrade-from-previous-versions).

This release also changes the C API. External applications will have to adapt the way they call liblouis. In particular the typeform parameter has changed.

* Will be replaced with the ToC

    -   Capitalization is now handled just like emphasis.
-   UTF-8 support for `lou_trace` thanks to Christian Egli.

## Bug fixes

-   Stop buffer overrun in `lou_getProgramPath`, and also free memory after usage. Thanks to Michael Curran.

## Other changes

    -   Output is printed to `stderr`. This helps with locating errors when testing with the YAML test suite.

## Backwards incompatible changes

-   The C API regarding the typeform parameter has changed.

# Next release

This is the first in a series of alpha releases leading up to the 3.0 release which will hopefully happen before the summer holidays. There are still a number of known [outstanding issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestones/3.0) and possibly some that we haven't discovered yet. Please help to find bugs by testing this alpha release.
